Enforces an order over two or more subtrees that fill the variables 
specified in `order` when the pattern is applied at the location given by `path`.
Use an `Ordered` constraint for enforcing this throughout the entire search space.

    function propagate!(solver::Solver, c::LocalOrdered)

Enforce that the [`VarNode`](@ref)s in the `tree` are in the specified `order`.
First the node located at the `path` is matched to see if the ordered constraint applies here.
The nodes matching the variables are stored in the `vars` dictionary.
Then the `order` is enforced within the [`make_less_than_or_equal!`](@ref) tree manipulation.
