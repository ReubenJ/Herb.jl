    abstract type Solver

Abstract constraint solver. 
Each solver should have at least the following fields:
- `statistics::SolverStatistics`
- `fix_point_running::Bool`
- `schedule::PriorityQueue{AbstractLocalConstraint, Int}`

Each solver should implement at least:
- `post!`
- `get_tree`
- `get_grammar`
- `set_infeasible!`
- `isfeasible`
- `HerbCore.get_node_at_location`
- `get_hole_at_location`
- `notify_tree_manipulation`
- `deactivate!`
